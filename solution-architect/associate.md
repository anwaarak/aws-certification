4. High Availability and Scalability
Next is the fourth supporting course: High Availability and Scalability for Associate AWS Solutions Architects. The exam has been redesigned to feature the architecture and implementation of AWS services and resources, rather than specific numbers and facts about AWS resources and services. 

The updated exam questions were much more focused on Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, and Route 53, so make sure you understand what each is and how it works. Plus, itâ€™s important to know how Route 53 integrates with other services, as well as latency for Route 53 routing.
